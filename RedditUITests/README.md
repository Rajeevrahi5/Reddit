#  UI Tests using POM

## The POM(page object model) strategy is followed here in to create this framework.

## This framework is divided into 3 parts:
### 1. Utilities (Helper methods to support the test)
### 2. ScreenObjects (We identify all the elements of individual screen here and its behaviour)
### 3. Tests(The actual tests which we need to execute)

### So, whenever we run any test from `Test->ReddItTutorialTest` it starts identifying the corresponding screen(By the object created) and find the required method which is defined there.
